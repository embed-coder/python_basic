## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project includes all the basic algorithms and feature from python.
It's convenient for a quick reference in the case we are learning python as long as learn some new feature if the project already had.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python version 3.8 is used to develop the project. Please use the python version at least 3.8 to avoid any undesirable faults.
- Please don't be hesitate to contribute to the project if you find any new features or good code that need to be included in the project and help the community learn python better.
- Each source file or sub-project folder should be numbered the name follow the order added into this project, which makes everyone easily target the source file when discussing.

### Installing

The list of required modules to run all the source files will be listed in "install_modules.py".

Please run follow command if you want to install all in once:

```
python3 install_modules.py
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>


### Run directly from source file

```
python3 <source_file.py>
```
### Build out binary file and run

Binary file will be build out by PyInstaller. Makefile would be prepared for each of project directory. just run make in apropriate directory would be ok.

```
make
./<build_out_binary_file>
```
